# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 9th December, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I fixed an issue with the React Datepicker displaying behind the edges of it's parent component.

React Datepicker has an option to pass in a portal component to keep the date picker outside of the restricting element in the HTML. Therefore, removing the overflow restriction.

**Thoughts:** Interesting fact: `The computed values of ‘overflow-x’ and ‘overflow-y’ are the same as their specified values, except that some combinations with ‘visible’ are not possible: if one is specified as ‘visible’ and the other is ‘scroll’ or ‘auto’, then ‘visible’ is set to ‘auto’.`
Basically, this:
```
overflow-x: visible;
overflow-y: auto;
```
turns into this:
```
overflow-x: auto;
overflow-y: auto;
```

### Day 2: 10th December, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did a little re-factor of my latest project and added in React Modal

**Thoughts:** I'm interested in working out how to style the modal to be a little more neat. Maybe a little smaller on the page.

It's also interesting that it's just as easy to implement the modal in both a Class and Function component.

### Day 3: 11th December, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I did some styling with styled-components and quite a lot of testing work today, mainly jest/enzyme

**Thoughts:** I was having a bit of a tough time with Enzyme and testing UI components, definitely need to sit down with a senior tomorrow and get a push in the right direction!

### Day 4: 12th December, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did some pair programming with a senior dev and re-factored some of my work

**Thoughts:** Pair programming with someone senior can be very insightful! Even just talking through your code with someone is really useful.

I'm building a comonent that extends someone else's work and I found myself making decisions to match their code, without really deciding if it had been written well to begin with.

Definitely a point for future reflection when building from existing code.

### Day 5: 13th December, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today was quite a lot of PRing

**Thoughts:** The better quality the comments and notes both in the code and the PR, the easier it is for the reviewer to digest.

### Day 6: 14th December, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I spent some time working through challenges on codewars - it's a nice way to challenge yourself!

**Thoughts:** How do I return multiple things from a function? Hmmm.
